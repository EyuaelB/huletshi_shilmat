# huletshi_shilmat


This is a simple web app  hosting a machine learning model built with streamlit that predicts my daily income from my current job at hulet shi habesha as a sound man for a band.

The income comes from customers as they give money to dancers and singer and muscians in expression of their appreciation of the entertainment of the night. this then all counted and divided equally b/n all wmuscians, singers and dancers and sound engineer(me).

The data is only 19 records but I'll update it reatime in the future.
