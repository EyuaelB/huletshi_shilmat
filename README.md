# huletshi_shilmat

This is a simple web app hosting a machine learning model  with streamlit Frontend that predicts my daily income from my current job at hulet shi habesha as a sound man for a band.

The income comes from customers as they give money to dancers and singer and muscians in expression of their appreciation of the entertainment of the night. this then all counted and divided equally b/n all muscians, singers and dancers and sound engineer(me).

The data is only 32 records and counting, I'll be updating it in realtime.
